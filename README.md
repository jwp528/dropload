<h2>Dropload helps with the heavy lifting</h2>
<p>dropload was created to help developers coding multi-select forms have an easier time doing so. Customize your options or choose from the presets!</p> 
<p>To use dropload customly, create 2 arrays, 1 for your initial dropdown, and the second for the options of the second select form. there's no need to create the second select input as dropload will do this automatically, then create your form as you normally would, but instead of hardcoding the dropdown values create the initial value for the first dropdown, and pass the select input's <i>'id'</i> to dropload along with the arrays to have it generate your options for you!<p>
